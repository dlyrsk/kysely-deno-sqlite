# Kysely SQLite Deno

A dialect for [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/) that uses [deno-sqlite](https://github.com/dyedgreen/deno-sqlite).

## Usage

```ts
import { Kysely } from 'npm:kysely';
import { DB as Sqlite } from 'https://deno.land/x/sqlite/mod.ts';
import { DenoSqliteDialect } from 'https://gitlab.com/soapbox-pub/kysely-deno-sqlite/-/raw/main/mod.ts';

const db = new Kysely({
  dialect: new DenoSqliteDialect({
    database: new Sqlite('db.sqlite3'),
  }),
});
```

Now you can use Kysely as intended!

```ts
const me = 'alex';

const query = db.selectFrom('users').selectAll()
  .where('name', '=', me)
  .limit(1);

const user = await db.executeTakeFirst();
```

## About

Previously you couldn't use Kysely with SQLite on Deno, because the built-in support uses `better-sqlite3` which only works on Node.js. This dialect uses `deno-sqlite` instead, so it will work on Deno. Otherwise, the functionality is the same.
